This repository contains data structures and algorithms that helps you prepare for interviews and understand them on a deeper level.

There are two main folders data_structures and algorithms. The names are self-explanatory.

data-structures
- contains the data structures that one has to learn to be able to solve algorithms or apply them on a problem that you're solving in a codebase.

algorithms
- leetcode questions and solutions, algorithmic patterns.
- for every algorithm - there will be a question link at the top and solution approach written followed by the code.
- read the question description on the website link before looking at the approach/code to make better sense of it logically.
